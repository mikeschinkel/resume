# FAQ — About hiring Mike Schinkel 

When you find yourself answering the same questions over and over again, that means it should be written down in documentation. That's what this is.  

## Recruiters & Hiring Managers:  

All your non-resume questions about Mike Schinkel are likely answered here! 
  
## 1. Are you available onsite, hybrid, or remote?  

I _prefer remote_, but I would consider hybrid-onsite or even onsite in limited circumstances.  

- **Remote** — **Any remote scenario works** great for me, _even_ for [PST](https://time.is/PST) hours.
- **Hybrid** — I **highly open to once-a-week hybrid**, anywhere in Metro Atlanta. The more days
  in-office per week, the closer the office needs to be to Midtown Atlanta.
- **Onsite** — Only if **less than 15 minutes from Midtown Atlanta** during rush hour.  

This means I am not interested in full-time onsite anywhere in what is considered Greater 
Atlanta, such as Alpharetta or Marietta, two places I frequently get recruiters contacting me for 
onsite roles.  

My _primary_ issue with onsite is simply all the unproductive and unpaid hours traveling I would
end up having to spend _(OTOH, if the client allows me to bill for my travel time, then I am all 
ears.)_ 
  
## 2. Can we hire you on W2, or only C2C?  

My _overwhelming preference_ is to work long-term [C2C](https://www.upcounsel.com/corp-to-corp) 
for a client where the client contracts my own LLC [NewClarity Consulting](https://www.newclarity.net) for me to work on their projects and/or on their team _(and only me, no subcontractors.)_   

### But would you consider being hired on W2?
I _might_ consider W2, but only in **_truly exceptional_** circumstances.  An early but 
funded startup comes to mind.   

But generally, **no**.  

### Why won't you just consider being hired on W2?
My entire life I have run my own company. It is part of my identity, part of who I am.   

I have not punched a clock since before I graduated from Georgia Tech decades ago, and having my 
own company also gives me the flexibility in my day-to-day life.  

However, whenever I am working for a client I get very focused on their work and give 110% to 
whichever project they have me working on.   

Also, I am best when I focus on one client at a time which means I would not plan to nor 
intend to work on any other client's project while working for a main client.  I _might_ 
pick up a single-weekend project if a friend needed my help, but that's about the extent I could 
handle without slitting my focus.  

But probably most importantly, I want to keep my company going to be able to maintain all my 
company's digital and financial assets — domain name, Google Suite account, etc. — and also for tax 
purposes. And since I do best when I focus on one client at at time, becoming a W2 employee 
would effectively mean the death of my company I have run for so long.  

## 3. What rate on C2C do you require?  

My standard hourly rate is `$100`/hour.  I have billed that, or more, over the past 
decade _(as of Feb 2025)._  

However, I would consider slightly less for opportunities that provide me with growth in my skills 
and experience that    

## 4. What type of company do you prefer?  

If I had my preference I would be working for a well-funded startup that is building a software 
product for its customer's use and where my senior-level skills and experience can contribute 
greatly to their success.

However, I am highly adaptable and can fit into organizations of any size, as long as the team I 
am on has great people and the manager on the team considers me a strong and unique asset for 
their team.

Having worked earlier in my career building websites for those who were in charge of marketing I 
am today a lot more interested in working in the IT side of the business where engineering 
excellence is both necessary and expected, such as those with acute appreciation for testing 
and for automation _(e.g. [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) and [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), two of my passions.)_  

## 5. What is your work style? 

My work style differs depending on if I am working solo on a project, or if I am on a team.  

If I am hired solo for a project then I work well taking the requirements and implementing the 
project. I will need a subject matter expert initially and then likely from time-to-time, but 
other than that I can take more projects and just run with it.  

However, if I am hired to participate on a team, I need to be highly collaborative. I do not do 
well to be placed on a team where everyone is siloed and the manager parcels out individual 
tasks where the only thing I am expected to do is to implement the task verbatim without asking 
questions or offering suggestions for improvement.  If that is the team's culture, please bypass me.  

OTOH, if the manager has a team where they view everyone on the team as an asset and is adept at 
harnessing the skills and experience of their team in a highly collaborative environment, I will 
thrive.  

## 6. What type of work do you prefer?  

Simply put, I like building long-lived things. I think that is why I have gravitated to software
development being my guilty pleasure over my entire, varied career.  

I especially enjoy working on projects that can have a significant positive impact on their 
users. I prefer to be involved in building products for external customers rather than internal 
customers, but working for an internal agency can scratch my _"customer"_ focus just as well.  

If I have the option I would love to work on open-source, and especially open-source that 
targets technical users, such as other software developers, DevOps, sysadmins, site reliability 
engineers, etc.   

## 7. What do you like to build?
Currently my interests focus on:  

1. Backend
3. Cloud
4. Testing
2. Containers and orchestration, and
5. Automation,   

What I really like to build include, but is not limited to:  

- Kubernetes [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/),
  [Extensions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/), and
  [Custom Resources & Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
- Microservices, especially leveraging [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi)
- Local build processes
- Enabling [local debugging](https://github.com/mikeschinkel/go-debuggable-k3d-pod)
- CD/CD pipelines, especially Github Actions
- Cross-platform CLI tools
- ISO & VM builders _(using Hasicorp's [Packer](https://www.packer.io/))_
- API integrations
- Data conversions
- Refactoring legacy apps

### What do you dislike building?
**Marketing websites**. They tend to be built for today, then rebuilt for tomorrow.   

Most of the marketing websites I built for clients during past projects were replaced within a 
few years as being the nature of the beast.  

OTOH, I would not put working on a SaaS website in the _"dislike"_ category.  

## 7. What cloud services do you know? 
I am currently only experienced with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), and if I had my preference I would get to continue working with AWS to gain even more AWS skills, experience, and expertise.  

I have no experience with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) nor with [Azure]
(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), although as long as I would be working on Linux vs. 
Windows platforms, I think I could come up to speed quickly. _(I do have Windows and Powershell 
experience, but it is not the area I am currently strongest in.)_  

## 7. What O/Ses do you know?
My **daily driver is macOS**, and I have a lot of both user and CLI experience on 
macOS. I have written [Objective-C via Go's `cgo`](https://github.com/mikeschinkel/prefsctl). Not that I have never programmed in Swift. 

I have developed strong Bash skills on **Linux server**. I have used Linux as
a developer workstation for a project, but I prefer macOS for the fact macOS is not a fragile as Linux desktop when trying to configure for me to be productive, and I would rather spend time on the client's project rather than configuring my workstation.   

I have experience with **Debian Server** which is what I used for VMs hosted in my homelab 
[**VMware ESXi server**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESXi), and I have worked with and built 
[ISOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_image) for both **Ubuntu server** and **Cent O/S server** while working for [HPE](https://www.hpe.com/).  

And I of course have worked extensively with Alpine Linux when building Docker containers.

And while I started my career on Windows, I switched to macOS in 2009 for its better developer support and have not looked back. I have created [ISO images for Windows](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/cloud-production/aws-windows-image) and have written a lot of code in [Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) while at HPE, but I would not claim that Window's expertise is my strong suit.   

## 7. What do you excel in? 
Today, my primary skills and experience are in the following _(as of Feb 2025):_

### Languages
1. **Golang** — Six (6) years _(my current favorite.)_
2. **Bash** — Seven (7) years _(what a workhorse; it runs everywhere!)_ 
3. **SQL** — Twenty+ (20+) years _(SQL has always been my jam.)_
4. **PHP** — Ten (10) years _([I wish I did not have this experience](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/), but hey!)_

While I have expertise in PHP, I do not want to work with PHP again. I would be willing to do some PHP work very occasionally, if needed by a client, and I would especially be willing to work with PHP if it meant porting an application to Go.

### Go Packages and Tools
The following list excludes anything in the Go standard library — which is what I use whenever possible — and only includes 3rd party solutions that I reach for on almost every Go project:
1. **oapi-codegen** — 
2. **sqlc** — 
3. **YAML** —
3. **Echo** —
4. **Goreleaser** —

### What about moderate experience?

These are in no particular order:

#### Languages
- [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) — _(I can write JS, and generally do mind it if programming for the browser, but would not want it to ever be the focus on any project I would work on, and definitely not if it meant having to work with [Node](https://nodejs.org/)/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (although I am curious about [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).)_
-  [**JQ**](https://jqlang.org/) — _(Some people may not think of `jq` as a programming language, but I do. `jq` is a brilliant tool that gives shell scripts superpowers.)_

- [**HTMX**](https://htmx.org/) — _(I have built Chrome browser extension to scratch my own itch, and I used HTMX combined with a Go daemon running locally on my daily driver. I chose HTMX because of its full-throated embrace of [hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/) and principles of [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) that believe in.)_
- [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) — _(I used Tailwind CSS for the Chrome browser extension and surprisingly found it to be far easier to work with than when using [semantic CSS](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/).)_

- [**SingleStore**]() — _(I did work for them for almost a year on their Kubernetes Operator team)_

### What do you want to avoid?
There is only so much time in the day, so I have decided these are too deep and broad for me to dip my toe in otherwise I will likely fall into the rabbit hole and never make my way back:
- **Java** — _(why write a 10,000 line program in Java when 1000 in Go will do?)_
- **C#/.NET** — _(too Java like, and too Microsoft-centric.)_
- **Python** — _(indention in YAML is bad enough, but in a programming language?)_
- **Ruby** — _(the aughts called and [want their programming language back](https://www.syntax-stories.com/2024/12/why-ruby-is-not-widely-used.html))_
- **TypeScript** — _(because using it [requires a build process](https://www.webdevtutor.net/blog/typescript-build-deploy))_
- **PHP** — _([a fractal of bad design](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/), even though I have 10 years experience)_
- [**SPA Websites**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) — _([React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), etc.)_
- [**Marketing websites**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) — _(Any whose sponsor is not the CTO or IT department)_

### What would you want to learn?
If I had projects that leveraged my existing experience but also allowed me to start working with any of these I would seriously consider your project, in order of my interest:

- [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) — _([Everyone else is doing it, why can't me?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Else_Is_Doing_It,_So_Why_Can%27t_We%3F))_
- [**Swift**](https://www.swift.org/) — _(How else am I going to write good macOS/iOS apps?!?)_
- [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) — _(A [JIT-compiled, better-typed Python alternative for Data Science](https://datascience.statnett.no/2022/09/19/julia-a-powerful-alternative-to-python/)!)_
- [**Kotlin**](https://kotlinlang.org/) — _(maybe...if I ever need to [write an Android app](https://developer.android.com/kotlin))_

### Technologies

- [**Ansible**]() — _(I am currently **planning** to learn Ansible for my own needs.)_
- [**MongoDB**]() — _(I have yet to have a project that needs MongoDB but I have set it up in my Homelab to try it out.)_



## 8. What SaaS tools do you prefer?

Github is #1, of course, although I can use Gitlab if that is what is needed.

I really prefer using **Slack** with team communication, and thrive on a team that uses it well. I also prefer **Zoom** for video conferencing since both of them have the best user experience, IMO. 

I do not like using Microsoft Teams, but I can adapt when other aspects of the opportunity are a good fit.  

I have used [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), I have used [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), I have used [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), and many, 
many other SaaS tools.   

I do not love JIRA, but do mind using JIRA.  There are so many other project management/task 
tracking tools I have used besides JIRA, and none of them are perfect, so I pretty much can use 
them all. I have once worked on a project that used [Shortcut](https://www.shortcut.com/) and really did like it better than any others I have used. I do like working on developer teams that actively use a ticket-tracking system, as they help keep me and others focused on the most important next tasks. 

OTOH, I find Confluence to be nothing more than a dumping ground for content that few it anyone ever seems to maintain. I think part of that is because I find Confluence to have a poor user-experience. OTOH I have found Notion to have a great user-experience, and prefer to use it if possible.   

## 9. What is your view on meetings?  

I view meetings as necessary and at times helpful. But I am not a fan of meetings that do not 
have well-defined objectives or that exist just because there is a periodic schedule to have a 
certain type of meeting.  If the meeting has no defined specific agenda then I would prefer to 
handle it in Slack, and instead schedule targeted meetings to cover specific topics in a 
collaborative mode. And I especially think several day off-sites no more frequent than once every 
four (4) months can be super-helpful for keeping teams aligned and in-sync.    

For many years I was a professional programming trainer before being a team lead, so I have the 
aptitude and interest in educating and leading other developers on a team, especially if they 
are junior developers.   

Also, I am a big believer in [Technical Guilds](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/stories/how-guilds-promote-the-exchange-of-technical-ideas-best-practices-within-bloomberg-engineering/) and think periodic guild meetings are worth their time in gold.

## What are your weaknesses?  

I am not a good project manager. I prefer to be a software engineer, and if I have to do both them I will do both poorly. Though I can be a team lead because team lead is not about managing priorities and deadlines, it is about building up a team.

I do not flourish if I constantly have to task switch between different project. I need a primary focus.

I am not interested in being on-call, e.g. I do not want a site-reliability role.

And I'm not a morning person. I've tried to be my entire life, but I have never been able to change my body clock. I _can_ be available every day at 9am EST, but if that is required I will be half asleep most of the time and not as productive as I would normally be. I work much better on PST hours.

## How can we entice you to join us?  

Want me to be especially excited to work for you?

- Let me work on software products. Give me products to work on that have a positive impact. 

- Solicit and respect my input as I am a great problem solver.

- Let me work on open-source projects that are core offerings from your organization.

- If your organization uses Github, and Slack and Zoom instead of MS Teams, that is a big plus.

- Do not require me to be onsite more than once or twice per week. Host bi-annual off-sites with your team for really focused planning productivity.

- Have Technical Guilds, or be willing to introduce them.

- Also, respect my best working hours. 


## What makes you special?
